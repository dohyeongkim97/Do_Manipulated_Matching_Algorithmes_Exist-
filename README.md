# Do_Manipulated_Matching_Algorithmes_Exist-

A statistical study on league of legends' matching algorithms. 

Despite the official statement which is denying the existence of any matchmaking manipulation system, such as placing players on a 'loser's team' after a win streak, many players remains skeptical.

Therefore, this study investigates whether such a system exists.

Specially, I'll analyse the question, "If a player is on a winning streak, is there matchmaking still fair?"
